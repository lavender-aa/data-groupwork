# Tasks
This file is for keeping track of what tasks need done and who has been assigned to each one. This list will grow over time.

## Syntax
- `- [ ]`: unchecked box (must include space)
- `- [x]`: checked box

## How To Use This Readme
- add yourself to any tasks you want to do (after the "--")
- mark tasks done by your PR with an x
- add new tasks as they appear
- don't add too many tasks; this won't be used for credit, just for keeping track/staying organized
- for details, see the rubric. if that's not enough, you can ask the group chat or just do it one way and wait for a review
